This project uses Build Configuration Adjust for it's build system.
While the project distributable of this is/will be included with the
tarball releases, it is not included in the git repository. Therefor,
to work with directly with the source tree from git, install BCA. More
likely in such a use case, one would clone the BCA tree as well, do a
build, but not install. Then soft link ./native/bca-candidate from the 
BCA source folder to, ./bca in the Build Matrix source folder.
